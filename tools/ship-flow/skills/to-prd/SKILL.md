# to-prd — publish a PRD from conversation context

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a PRD. Do NOT interview the user — just synthesize what you already know.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already. Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary throughout the PRD (e.g. a root `CONTEXT.md`, if this repo keeps one), and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

2. Sketch out the seams at which you're going to test the feature. Existing seams should be preferred to new ones. Use the highest seam possible. If new seams are needed, propose them at the highest point you can.

Check with the user that these seams match their expectations.

3. Write the PRD using the template below, then publish it as a **document in the project** (not as an issue):
   - Determine the target project on this repo's issue tracker (Linear's Project is the worked example — other trackers may call the equivalent grouping an epic, milestone, or something else). **If no project exists yet for this work, create the project first**, then create the PRD document under it.
   - Create the PRD as a **project document**, if this repo's tracker has a document/PRD concept — Linear's Document feature is the worked example. If the tracker has no separate document concept, the closest equivalent (e.g. a pinned top-level issue) is fine. The PRD document doesn't need this repo's issue-workflow labels, if it uses them — those apply to issues, not documents. Any actionable label marking work ready to pick up belongs on the slice issues produced later by `to-issues`, which reference this PRD document as their source.

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## User Stories

A LONG, numbered list of user stories. Each user story should be in the format of:

1. As an <actor>, I want a <feature>, so that <benefit>

<user-story-example>
1. As a mobile bank customer, I want to see balance on my accounts, so that I can make better informed decisions about my spending
</user-story-example>

This list of user stories should be extremely extensive and cover all aspects of the feature.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it within the relevant decision and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Testing Decisions

A list of testing decisions that were made. Include:

- A description of what makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which modules will be tested
- Prior art for the tests (i.e. similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this PRD.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.
